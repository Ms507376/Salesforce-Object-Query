1)What is SOQL ? Differnece between SQL and SOQL?
   SOQL stands for Saleforce object query Language .It is used to retrieve the data from Salesforce Database.
   SQL is a programming language that's used to query and manage data in a database,while SOQL is a language used specifically to query data from Salesforce.
    SQL allows  all modifying statements like UPDATE, INSERT but SOQL it does not allow data modifying statements like UPDATE, INSERT.


2) Commands available in SOQL ?
   a) SELECT > SELECT Name, Type, BillingCountry FROM Account 
             >SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Type = ‘Customer’ ( where clause)
   b) LIMIT > SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Type = ‘Customer’ LIMIT 5(LIMIT is used to define how many records we wish to pull.If no LIMIT Is used, SOQL will pull every record available)
   c) ORDER BY>SELECT Name FROM Account ORDER BY AnnualRevenue DESC( ORDERBY is used to sort query result it can be ascending or descending)
   d) AND, OR >SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Type = ‘Customer’ AND BillingCountry = ‘USA’
              > SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE BillingCity = ‘London’ OR BillingCountry = ‘USA’
   e)LIKE >SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email FROM Contact WHERE Email LIKE ‘%force.com%’
   f) IN> SELECT Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN (SELECT AccountID FROM CustomObject__c WHERE Type__c = ‘Customer’)(IN allows you to filter results with the WHERE clause against a list of values)
   g)GROUPBY>SELECT LeadSource, COUNT(Company) FROM Lead GROUP BY LeadSource(GROUP BY is used with aggregate functions to summarise data and roll up query results)
   h) COUNT() >SELECT COUNT(Id) FROM Account ( Used to count the number of rows matching the query criteria.)
   i)COUNT_DISTINCT>SELECT COUNT_DISTINCT(Company) FROM Lead ( Returns the number of distinct non-null field values matching the query criteria)
   j)MIN() >SELECT MIN(AnnualRevenue) FROM Account
   k)MAX()>SELECT MAX(AnnualRevenue) FROM Account
   l)SUM()>SELECT SUM(Amount) FROM Opportunity WHERE IsClosed = false AND Probability > 60
   m)AVG()>SELECT AVG(Amount) FROM Opportunity WHERE Type = ‘New Customer’

3) Salesforce Date Literals
  Command	     Example
   TODAY	        SELECT Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CloseDate = TODAY
 YESTERDAY	     SELECT Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CloseDate = Yesterday
 TOMORROW	     SELECT Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CloseDate = TOMORROW
THIS_WEEK	     SELECT Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CloseDate = THIS_WEEK
NEXT_MONTH	     SELECT Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CloseDate = NEXT_MONTH
LAST_90_DAYS    SELECT Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CLOSEDate = LAST_90_DAYS
LAST_MONTH	    SELECT Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CLOSEDate = LAST_MONTH
THIS_YEAR	    SELECT Name, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity WHERE CLOSEDate = THIS_YEAR

4)  what is limit of SOQL in Salesforce and how you can overcome it?
     Using SOQL we can retrieve maximum 50,000  record per transaction.
     To overcome this:
     we use pagination with OFFSET and LIMIT clauses,which allows retrieval of data in smaller chunks.
     By using Batch Apex which processes large data sets asynchronously by breaking them into manageable batches.
